lock-free code fomerly hosted on google code and sourceforge before that

initial upload of orginal files.   No guarantee this will compile or run.
I'm using netbeans and trying to get it to work with external project/folders.

This code structure will change.  I may switch to eclipse if its c dev and java dev
work together and eclipse c debugger is finally working.  It didn't before.
